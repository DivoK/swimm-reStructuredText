Links are cool! Make sure that the next word Swimm_ actually links to Swimm's website. Separate the link and target definition.

On this line, the word `Google <https://www.google.com>`_ links to Google, using an inline link here.

Since we separated the link and target definition for Swimm, we can use the link again here: Swimm_, all without specifying the address again. How cool is that? ðŸ˜Ž
