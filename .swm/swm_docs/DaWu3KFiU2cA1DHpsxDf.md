# ReST

## What is it?

reStructuredText (or ReST, for short) is a markup language. That means it's useful for creating content that's WYSIWYM - What You See Is What You Mean. You can use ReST to write great-looking and easy to maintain technical documents, and not worry about the formatting too much.

But hey - don't take my word for it, I'm just a Swimm unit. From [Write The Docs' "Introduction to reStructuredText:](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/writing/reStructuredText/)

> reStructuredText is a lightweight markup language, so it’s easier to read in plain-text format compared to heavier markup languages like DITA and other XML-based formats. You can easily find text editors that render reStructuredText with syntax highlighting and live previews, without having to invest in complex tools.
> 
> Compared to some other lightweight markup languages like MarkDown, reStructuredText contains stronger semantic markup tools. Some writers also prefer reStructuredText because the markup standards are more well-defined compared to MarkDown.
