We will use a cool setup so you can get an interactive feeling while completing this playlist.

# Prerequisites
* Have Python installed on your machine.

# Installation
* Install Poetry if you don't have it already. You can run `pip install --user poetry` or find your preferred way [in the official docs](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).
* Run `poetry install` from within the root directory of this repo. This will install everything you need! ✨
* Run `poetry shell`, now you are within the virtual environment.

# Make sure it works
Within the virtual environment, run the following command:
`sphinx-autobuild --open-browser docs docs/_build`

Wait for a few seconds, and your browser will open. You should be able to see something that looks like this:
